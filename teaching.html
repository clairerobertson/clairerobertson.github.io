<p>As a teacher, I strive to be rigorous, interactive, and inclusive in my classroom. I give my students tools to find answers, rather than give them answers directly. I believe that active learning is essential for lasting learning, and that it is most important for students to learn critical thinking skills rather than simply memorizing facts. I work not only to teach fundamental content that must be covered, but also skills that students can use to apply content in new situations. In my graduate career at New York University (NYU), I have sought out a wide array of teaching experiences across our undergraduate and graduate programs and including classes of all sizes, from nine to 433 students. These experiences have given me the opportunity to hone the skills and techniques for successful teaching. Moreover, the joy and sense of accomplishment that I derived from instruction and mentorship has strengthened my resolve to become a professor with a commitment to excellent teaching. You can see my syllabus for Introduction to Psychology, for which I was Instructor on record, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q1miBbFJyXMSF_1aVdKaSzN_I-rvNwL_/view">here</a>, and all of my student evaluations <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14R3LvHatZnkCUEH3WXiLrN3iMDZ-EoXP/view">here</a>.

<strong>Teaching Stratagies </strong>
</p>
  
<p>I believe that active learning is crucial to lasting learning. I employ strategies like “Think, Pair, Share” to foster class participation and encourage critical thinking. In my Introduction to Psychology course, I asked the students to read a vignette I had created about a hypothetical “researcher” who conducts a shoddy experiment. I had the students write down any issues they could see with the experiment, then pair up and compare notes. After these small group discussions, we reconvened to talk through the problems with the experiment and how the researcher could fix them. Exercises like this foster deeper learning than memorization by enabling students to discover real-world applications of material themselves. The students also enjoy Think Pair Share – even my shyest students felt confident enough to share their ideas with the entire class, and 100% of students responded that they “strongly agreed” that I was effective at facilitating class discussion throughout the course. </p> 

<p>Along with fostering critical thinking skills, my goal in my classes is to increase my students’ scientific literacy. Along with the basic curriculum, my Introduction to Psychology course integrated activities that taught students how to break down and understand scientific articles. I introduced a reading system called “QUARI” method (Question, Answer, Results, Interpretation) that helped students learn how to break down and identify the components of scientific articles. Over the semester they completed several QUARI assignments both individually and in small groups. At the end of the semester, students were asked to use their new skills to write a blog post about a scientific article of their choosing. Reading the students’ submissions was a joy – overwhelmingly, they had done an excellent job, showing marked improvement from the first few QUARI exercises we had done in class. The assignment was a great way to evaluate their growth, and I was thrilled that they walked away from the course with improved scientific literacy. </p>

<p>Furthermore, I am committed to continuing to encourage diversity, equity, and inclusion in both my teaching and my research, fostering a space where students of all backgrounds can succeed and – more importantly – where they can feel they can take risks, push themselves, and pursue their passions. As a teacher, I have work to demystify higher education, explaining the “hidden curriculum” to level the playing field for students of all backgrounds. In the classroom, I employ several pedagogical practices with this aim. For example, the concept of “office hours” (which I now call “student hours”) can be foreign to incoming students. To combat this, I ask students to buddy up and schedule a time to come to my office hours together, as an early-semester homework assignment. This facilitates social engagement and demystifies office hours. Second, I go over study skills early in Introduction to Psychology courses, backed up with research on how best to study.  This helps students who were not trained in these skills succeed in the classroom and in the college environment more broadly. For students who find this type of training redundant, it is important to remind them that study skills and knowledge of higher education systems are not innate abilities, but rather skills that are learned and trained over time. </p>
