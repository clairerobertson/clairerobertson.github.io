        <p>I study how social and emotional processes are amplified in online contexts. My prior work has focused on exploring how emotion, social identity, and morality influence media consumption, extremism and conspiracy theories, and attentional processes in the online world.</p>
        <p>I am currently in my final year of my PhD at New York University, where I work primarily with Professor Jay Van Bavel.</p>
